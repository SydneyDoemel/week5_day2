HOME PAGE:
    -Displays the current rankings/total points on the home page 
    (if info is saved to database)

SEARCH CHARACTERS:
    -Not really a necessary page, but I wanted the 
    user to be able to see the stats before saving a character

SAVE CHARACTERS:
    -If user has not saved any characters: displays form to save 5 characters.
    You have to add all five at once (I know how to fix this but didn't have time.)
    -If user has saved their 5 characters: displays saved characters and
     gives option to update/change individual characters.

PROFILE/SETTINGS DROPDOWN
