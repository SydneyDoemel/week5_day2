HOME PAGE:
    -Displays the current rankings on the home page 
    (if info is saved to database)

SEARCH CHARACTERS:
    -Not really a necessary page, but I wanted the 
    user to be able to search the stats before saving the character

SAVE CHARACTERS:
    -If the user has not saved any characters, it displays a 
    form to save 5 characters. You have to add all
    five at once (I know how to fix this but didn't have time.)
    -If the user HAS saved their 5 characters already, this page shows the
    characters you have saved and gives you the option to update/
    change individual characters.

PROFILE/SETTINGS
    -Can edit personal information and view your saved pokes
